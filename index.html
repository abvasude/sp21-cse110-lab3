        <h1><b>Wednesday Morning</b></h1>
            <p> On Wednesday morning, I woke up in the morning around 7:30 am and prepared to 
                go get my first vaccine. I quickly ate breakfast and around 8 am, my mom and I headed
                off to Pittsburg, California to get my Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
                <h2> Appointment </h2>
                    <p>After a 45 minute drive, I finally arrived at the health center in which I had to 
                    wait for 25 minutes because of the long line. After around 35 people moved forward,
                    I finally was able to enter. Then, I was asked to provide my personal information and
                    once that was done, I entered the room where there were 12 stations set up for the vaccine to be distributed.
                    I waited for a minute or so and then they quickly asked some more information before injecting me with the vaccine.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Observation </h3>
                    <p>Soon after I was placed in an observation room for 15 minutes where I 
                    read about the possible side effects of the Pfeizer vaccine and how effective it
                    is. During the 7 minute mark, <strong>one lady started screaming at the top of her lungs and everyone jumped from their seats</strong>.
                    I thought to myself, <i>Everything is fine. It was probably an allergic reaction to the vaccine. I probably do not have to worry.</i> As it turns out, the lady was just on the phone and started yelling at someone at the top of her lungs in a foreign language.
                    After that happened, I spent the last 5 minutes on my phone when I was texting my mom about when she should pick me up.
                    </p>

                    <p>After a 50 minute car ride where my mom kept asking me what happened, if I feel okay, or if I need to sleep,
                        we finally arrived back home where I attended my classes.
                    </p>
        <hr>
        <h1><b>Wednesday Afternoon</b></h1>
         <p>Nothing truly exciting happened this afternoon. My arm was still in pain from the vaccine
             but I ate lunch (pasta with some steamed vegetables). I talked to my parents for some time and I 
             informed them time and time again that I am fine and I do not feel any of the major symptoms.
             After lunch, I had to watch the recording of the 9 AM class which I had missed.
         </p>
         <hr>
         <h1><b>Wednesday Evening</b></h1>
         I had chosen to rest for the remainder of the evening instead of starting on the CSE 110 Lab because I 
         had started to feel a little shortness in breath which is one of the side effects of the vaccine. As a result,
         I had a very light dinner (tomato soup with croutons) and immediately went to bed. I woke up in the middle of the night
         feeling hungry so I went downstairs and it was there that I felt a bit lightheaded. I <em>needed</em>to eat something or at least drink water
         to make sure that I wouldn't pass out. After sitting down for a bit and drinking some water, I felt better and went back to bed.

        <h1><b>Thursday</b></h1>
        My Thursday Morning was a typical day where I have 2 back to back classes from 9:30 to 12:20. After
        attending both of my classes, I ate lunch but I was too tired because of the vaccine. So, I ended up napping
        for 2 hours before having to attend my 4 PM Software Engineering class. Here we learned about the project and more information
        about what we needed to do in order to succeed. After that class, I remembered that I had to do a lab for my ECE 100 class 
        that was due the next day so I quickly got to work on that. After coding for a few hours on Matlab, I finally finished my report and
        submitted. When I am feeling stressed out, I like to watch videos of nature such as this one of the Earth.

            Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
        </video>
        </p>

        <p>In between, around 7 PM, I ate dinner and around 9 PM, once I finished the report, I went to bed.</p>

        <h1><b>Friday</b></h1>
        <h2><b>Friday Morning</b></h2>
        Friday was definitely an interesting day to say the least. When I got up around 8 AM, I was surprised to see my parents
        watching cricket downstairs. It was then that I remembered that this was the first day of the IPL and the match
        was <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Royal Challengers Bangalore</span> vs. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">the Mumbai Indians</span>. Knowing that these teams had a huge rivalry, I knew it would be a great game to watch. However, when I came downstairs,
        I realized that the match already started and it was almost time to switch the batting and the bowling team.
        
        So, I asked my parents to give me a rundown of the important highlights from the first half.
        I asked them, "Who's batting?" <br>
        My dad said, "<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">Mumbai Indians</span>". <br>
        Then, I asked, "Did any bowler or batsman stand out?" <br>
        My mom replied, "Yes, one <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">RCB</span> bowler got 5 wickets in the game" <br>
        I replied with, "Wow". <br>
        My mom then said, "Stop asking questions and watch the game."<br>
        My mom is a huge fan of <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">RCB</span>.

        <h2><b>Friday Afternoon</b></h2>

        Anyway, after that, I attended my 9 AM class (ECE 111) and I planned out all the things I needed to do for the weekend.
        It was then that I realized that I had to do 2 quizzes and plenty of labs/homework assignments for the weekend. Usually, I 
        create voice memos for myself to remember that I need to do something.
        
        <figure>
            <figcaption>Here is one that I created for the two quizzes:</figcaption>

                    <code>audio</code> element.
            </audio>
        </figure>
        
        I created a list in order of 
        priority. 
        <p>List of things for me to do in order for the weekend</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Revise my ECE 100 Lab Report</li>
            <li> Take my CSE 101 Quiz</li>
            <li> Take the CSE 110 Quiz</li>
            <li> Do the CSE 110 Lab</li>
            <li> Finish the ECE 111 Assignment due next week</li>
            <li> Set up times to meet for the CSE 101 HW1</li>
        </ol>
        After this, I started to get to work.
        After finishing the first 2 out of my list, I keep thinking about how short spring break is and I wonder
        whether I can go back to Lake Tahoe where I spent a few days taking in the air.

        <details>
            <summary>Details about Friday Evening</summary>
             This evening, I basically spent my time working on the CSE 110 Lab and i spent the remainder of the evening playing Competitive Valorant.
             Although I really enjoy playing the game, the fact that I play on a laptop and with lag spikes makes the game almost unplayable.
